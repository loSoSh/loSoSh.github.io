# Portfolio Website

## Introduction

This project is created from the codecademy "Full stack engineer" course, and from the "portfolio website" exercise.

## Description

This website will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My objective is to make a website that is not ugly and a bit interactive.

The website will present my latest played video games. And will also provide a form to suggest some video games for me to play.
